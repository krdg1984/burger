Week 14 Homework - Node Express Handlebars

This is a burger log with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM. Be sure to use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

Although I personally do not eat meat. "Eat-Da-Burger" is an app that allows user input of burgers they'd like to eat (mostly Burger King). Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the top left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in this area has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the bottom right side of the page. Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
